# Finding Frequent Item Sets
### Finding Frequent Item Sets over millions shopping baskets: realized by SON algorithm on Spark in Python on AWS.

#### This project aims to discover correlated items customers most likely purchase together given big shopping basket dataset. It is implemented by SON Data Mining Algorithm via MapReduce with Spark on AWS, programming in Python. It calculates frequent item sets over millions of shopping basket records in just (<30) seconds.
